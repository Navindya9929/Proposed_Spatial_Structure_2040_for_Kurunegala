Kurunegala Local Development Project

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive development strategy for Kurunegala, focusing on human settlement patterns, dwelling environment, and overall spatial structure. Kurunegala, with its high residential and agricultural potential, is positioned as a future residential hub, facilitated by upcoming infrastructure developments. The project proposes a strategic approach to distribute the predicted population across the area while preserving environmentally sensitive zones.

The provided spatial structure map (Proposed Spatial Structure 2040) is a guiding tool for the urban planning and development of Kurunegala. It demonstrates:

*Housing Density Distribution: Zones with varying household densities are designated to manage population spread.

*Economic Hubs and Development Zones: Designated zones for commercial agriculture, agrotourism, ecotourism, industrial areas, and transit-oriented developments to stimulate local economic growth.

Population and housing data were used to analyze demand and density distribution across different zones, calculated based on average household size and projected population growth. This spatial structure map can be used to understand the distribution of different functional zones, household densities, and key areas for future developments in Kurunegala.
